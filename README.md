# Spatiotemporal Analysis on Winnipeg 311 Service Requests
 
## Abstract 
This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the service requests made to the Winnipeg 311 service system. The study used a dataset that included various types of service requests, from Boulevard Mowing to Water Main Leaks. The analysis delved deep into the temporal trends, revealing patterns related to the seasons and COVID-19 policy changes. Moreover, a spatial analysis was carried out, using regression to explore the relationships between different variables such as population density, poverty, education, unemployment, and the number of service requests. The study also examined the influence of factors like housing type, dwelling conditions, immigration status, visible minorities, and more on the service requests.
