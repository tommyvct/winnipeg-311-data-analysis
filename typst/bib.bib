Covid-19 virus started from Wuhan, China and has brought the world down to its knees. It has catapulted as a venomous global phenomenon. This study focuses on the Covid-19 situation in India and its recovery time.
Method
The study period is from March 1, 2020 to April 25, 2020. A random sample of 221 individuals found positive with Covid-19 from March 1, 2020 to 31st March is included in the study which is followed up April 25, 2020. There is a male preponderance in the sample with 66% of the Covid-19 patients being male and about 34% being female. Kaplan-Meier Product limit estimator, Kaplan-Meier survival curve and Log-rank test are used to analyze the recovery time of Covid-19 patients.
Result
From the results of the study, it is found that the average recovery time of Covid-19 patients in India is 25 days (95% C.I. 16 days to 34 days). Only 4% of the patients get cured after 10 days of treatment. The recovery time of male and female patients is not statistically different. Recovery time of patients belonging to different age groups is also not statistically significant.
Conclusion
This information on recovery time of Covid-19 patients will help planners to chalk out effective strategies.}
